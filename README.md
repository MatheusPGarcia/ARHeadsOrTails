# AR Heads Or Tails

## What it is
AR Heads Or Tails is a one week project made for me to learn about augmented reality. Being honest, I've never tryed anything like AR before, so it was a good challenge to create this app!
Oh yeah, and like the name says, it's a Head or Tails flip coin app.

## Learnings
 - ARkit.
 
## Plataform
the app was developed for iOS.
